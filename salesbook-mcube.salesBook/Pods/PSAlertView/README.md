PSAlertView & PSActionSheet
=============

Block-based subclasses for UIActionSheet and UIAlertView, extracted from the commercial [PSPDFKit PDF framework](http://PSPDFKit.com), because I love open source.

PSAlertView uses ARC and is tested with Xcode 4.5.2 (iOS 5.0+)

I'd love a thank you tweet if you find this useful.

Special thanks to Micha≈Ç Zaborowski who wrote some of the drawing code used when tintColor is set on PSPDFAlertView.
